@ProjectGuy100 - Most of the html code is made by me and the JavaScript is made by me.
@TheGeek1307 - Styled it with CSS and added some Website links to the Engine, also added all the good banners and Icons, fixed a lot of html code.
@syan212 - Added a bunch of sites to search and did kind of screw up a bit but it was a minor issue.
